# Analyzing Orders and Transaction Database with SQL

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of an Orders and Transaction database using SQL. The goal is to answer specific business questions related to the dataset. The project comprises three key files:

1. **OrdersSchemaQuestions.pdf:**
   - This PDF document describes the project and outlines the business questions that need to be addressed. It provides an overview of the project scope and objectives.

2. **database.sql:**
   - The `database.sql` file contains the SQL code representing the used database in this project. This file serves as the foundation for querying and extracting insights from the dataset.

3. **ordersschema.sql:**
   - The `ordersschema.sql` file contains SQL queries that answer the business questions outlined in the project. These queries are designed to provide meaningful insights into the dataset. Notably, the queries make use of basic SQL as well as subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to enhance the complexity of the analysis.

## Files

- [OrdersSchemaQuestions.pdf](OrdersSchemaQuestions.pdf): Project description and business questions.
- [database.sql](database.sql): SQL code for the used database in the project.
- [OrdersSchema.sql](OrdersSchema.sql): SQL queries answering the business questions.

## Usage

1. Review the project description and business questions in the provided [OrdersSchemaQuestions.pdf](OrdersSchemaQuestions.pdf).
2. Examine the database structure by checking [database.sql](database.sql).
3. Explore the SQL queries and their results in [ordersschema.sql](ordersschema.sql).
4. Run the queries in your SQL environment to obtain insights from the dataset.

## Note

The queries used in this project range from basic SQL to more advanced techniques, including the use of subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to perform comprehensive analysis.
